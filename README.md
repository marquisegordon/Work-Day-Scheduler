# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This project is a Work Day Scheduler, making it easier and faster to create and save tasks ou need to complete throughout your work day. The app is only set for the normal buisness hours (9AM-5PM) to better reflect an actual workday schedule.

- The motivation for this project was to better understand how to utilize th browser DOM and Third-Party-APIs.
- This project solves the problem of forgetting the tasks you need to complete throughout your day, not only by easily creating a to-do list based on time, but also making the information easily accessible.
